# Task Management System (MERN Stack)

## 📌 Project Overview
The Task Management System is a full-stack web application developed using the MERN stack.
The application helps users create, manage, and track tasks efficiently through a centralized platform.

This project is developed as part of an Engineering Internship to gain hands-on experience
with real-world full-stack application development.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand MERN stack architecture
- Design a structured backend system
- Implement RESTful APIs
- Follow industry-standard project structure
- Gain practical full-stack development experience

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Managing daily tasks manually or across multiple platforms can be inefficient.
This project aims to provide a centralized task management system where users
can create, update, view, and delete tasks easily.

## 📐 Project Scope

### In Scope
- User-based task management
- Task creation, update, deletion, and retrieval
- Backend API development
- Database integration using MongoDB

### Out of Scope
- Payment gateway integration
- Third-party service integrations
- Advanced analytics and reporting

---

## ⚙️ Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, VS Code

## 💻 System Requirements

### Software Requirements
- Node.js (v18 or above)
- MongoDB / MongoDB Atlas
- Git
- Visual Studio Code

### Hardware Requirements
- Minimum 8 GB RAM
- Stable internet connection

---

## 🏗️ High-Level Architecture
The application follows the MERN architecture where the frontend communicates
with the backend via REST APIs. The backend processes requests and interacts
with MongoDB using Mongoose for data persistence.
